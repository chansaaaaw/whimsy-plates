            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a bowl, combine warm milk and yeast. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture, eggs, and melted butter.</li>
                <li>Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes. Cover with a cloth and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Once risen, punch down the dough and roll it into small balls (about 1.5 inches in diameter). Place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough balls with a cloth and let them rise again for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C). Fry the bomboloni until golden brown on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
                <li>Drain on paper towels and let cool slightly. Fill with strawberry jam or pastry cream using a piping bag.</li>
                <li>Top with sliced strawberries and dust with powdered sugar before serving. Enjoy!</li>
