                <h2>Hello, I’m Chansa Nisrin!</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Whimsy Plates! I’m a student at SMKN 7 Semarang, majoring in Software and Game Development (PPLG), Class X PPLG 3. 
                    While I’m busy learning about coding and technology, my other passion is all things sweet and pretty, especially in the kitchen!
                    I created this website to share my love for baking and cooking with others who enjoy trying new, fun recipes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From fluffy pancakes and cinnamon rolls to appetizing main courses, I believe every dish can be a little piece of art, bringing joy and sweetness into our lives. 
                    My goal is to combine my creativity from coding with my passion for food, offering a collection of recipes that not only taste amazing but are also visually delightful!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As someone who loves both technology and the magic of the kitchen, I’m always experimenting, whether it's with code or ingredients. 
                    I hope this website inspires you to try new recipes and bring more flavor into your daily life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So feel free to explore, try out some of my favorite recipes, and join me on this sweet culinary journey!
